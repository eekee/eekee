- 👋 Hi, I’m @eekee
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of odd and unusual things! I've been using Forth for a few years; little bit tired of it now. I occasionally tinker with APL too, but I prefer Forth's left-to-right evaluation order over APL's right-to-left.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning plain English programming with the CAL-4700 compiler from the Osmosian Order of Plain English Programmers
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on being a social hermit. Wait, is that an oxymoron?
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, if you see me, you see me. In chat, my idle status is best determined by observation, just like Schrodinger's cat.
